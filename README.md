Hereâ€™s a summarized version of the provided lines condensed into **9 lines**:

Cancer remains the leading cause of death globally despite progress in research. Natural products have historically played a key role in anticancer drug discovery. Experimental and computational methods are used to identify anticancer compounds. This study introduces **DFT_ANPD**, a deep learning framework for predicting anticancer properties in natural compounds. It integrates molecular structural data with embeddings from large language models (LLMs). A 1D-CNN processes SMILES strings for chemical patterns, while a fine-tuned SMILES-BERT extracts semantic information. These insights are fused using a two-sided attention mechanism to prioritize relevant features, enabling prediction via a sigmoid activation function. DFT_ANPD outperformed existing methods, like iANP-EC, on NPACT, CancerHSP, and NPASS datasets, showing superior accuracy and generalization. Actinomycin D and Clavariopsin C were identified, proving the model's robustness and clinical relevance.
